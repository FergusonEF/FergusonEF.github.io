							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								Welcome to the third week of my DFAB elective blog! This week was all about exploring the fascinating
								world of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and its significance in the creation, modification, and
								optimization of designs. CAD software plays a crucial role in developing 2D and 3D models for a wide
								range of applications, including products, buildings, and mechanical parts.
							</p>
							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								Before diving into the CAD software itself, we first learned about the distinction between raster
								graphics and vector graphics. Raster graphics utilize a grid of colored pixels to form an image, with
								the quality and level of detail determined by the number of pixels used. On the other hand, vector
								graphics employ mathematical formulas to create shapes, lines, and curves, allowing for easy resizing
								without any loss of quality or detail. For raster editing, we used GIMP, while for vector editing, we
								utilized Inkscape.
							</p>
							<p class="text-animate-hide mb-0 pb-0">

								Week 6
								<span class="beside-header">(3D Printing)</span>
							</h2>
							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								In week six, we dived into the fascinating world of 3D printing, also known as Additive Manufacturing.
								3D printing allows us to create three-dimensional objects by building them layer by layer using a
								computer-controlled machine, commonly known as a CNC 3D printer.
							</p>
							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								There are several mainstream techniques in 3D printing, each with its own unique process. One popular
								technique is Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) or Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF). FDM involves melting
								a thermoplastic filament and depositing it layer by layer to create the object. The printer extrudes the
								molten material through a nozzle, following a predefined path. Another technique is Stereolithography
								Apparatus (SLA), which uses a liquid resin solidified layer by layer using a UV laser or other light
								sources. The UV light selectively cures the resin, resulting in intricate and smooth surfaces. Lastly,
								Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) utilizes a high-powered laser to selectively fuse powdered materials,
								such as plastics, metals, or ceramics, layer by layer. The laser sinters the powder particles, bonding
								them together to form the object. SLS is known for its versatility and ability to print complex
								geometries without the need for support structures.
							</p>
							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								During the week, we also had an engaging discussion to share our thoughts and insights on 3D printing.
								It was a great opportunity to exchange ideas, learn from one another, and explore the possibilities and

							</p>
							<p class="text-animate-hide mb-0 pb-0">
								Drawing inspiration from my childhood memories of playing Minecraft, I envisioned a box resembling the
								iconic Minecraft chest. This design felt fitting, considering the cubic nature of laser-cut objects. To
								enhance the functionality, I decided to incorporate drawers into the design. Ensuring the box met the
								size requirements was essential to maintain its usefulness as an accessory box. To my delight, I found a
								reference image online that closely resembled my envisioned design, complete with a living hinge
								feature, which was an added bonus in meeting the rubric criteria.

							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								With a reference image in hand, I delved into the CAD (Computer-Aided Design) stage. To boost my
								confidence and refine my skills, I turned to helpful YouTube tutorials, especially for mastering the
								intricacies of finger joints. These three videos played a pivotal role in my ability to create the
								accessory box in Fusion 360. Additionally, I found a video that provided a better visualization of the
								living hinge and its flexibility, which was essential for incorporating this unique feature into my
								design.

							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								Now came the moment of truth — the laser cutting stage. It proved to be both thrilling and challenging.
								I encountered several trial and error sessions to achieve a snug fit for the finger joints, as
								determining the kerf compensation took time and precision. Measuring the exact thickness of the wood
								played a crucial role in achieving accurate kerf compensation. Despite the challenges, I persevered and
								finally reached a satisfactory outcome. For the top lid design, I utilized a vector cut, while the
								topographic design employed scoring, as it covered a larger area and required faster processing.

							<h3 class="text-animate-hide">Assignment 1 - 3D Printing a Handphone Stand</h3>
							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								Let's delve into the journey of creating my 3D printed phone stand! The assignment began with the
								specifications and rubrics, and I must admit, I felt a sense of relief compared to the previous
								assignment. Designing a phone stand seemed more straightforward compared to the intricate accessory box.
								<br />
								<img
									src="static/images/assignment1-rubrics.png"
									alt="Assignment 1 Rubrics"
									width="600px"
									class="img-fluid" />
							</p>
							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								With my daily use of a phone stand in mind, I started contemplating my ideal phone stand design. I
								wanted it to address common pain points, such as elevated viewing for better posture and the ability to
								use it at a regular angle on a flat surface. While brainstorming, I stumbled upon a reference image that
								closely resembled my envisioned design:
								<br />
								<img
									src="static/images/assignment1-reference.png"
									alt="Assignment 1 Reference"
									width="400px"
									class="img-fluid" />
							</p>
							<p class="text-animate-hide mb-0 pb-0">
								Inspired by the reference image, I imagined how my design could work, taking note of the dimensions
								provided. I used rulers and protractors to recreate an imaginary reference phone stand and made minor
								modifications to suit my specific needs. Once I finalized the dimensions, I moved on to CAD it in Fusion
								360. While designing, I realised it was crucial for me to consider the center of gravity and the acting
								forces on the elevated section to ensure proper stability for the phone in the elevated angle position,
								hence the thicker base.
							</p>

							</h2>
							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								Welcome to the tenth week of my DFAB elective blog! After a refreshing short-term break, we delved into
								the exciting realm of embedded programming with Arduino. This week, we embarked on a digitalization
								journey, starting with the basics of programming and diving straight into a simplified version of the
								C++ language.
							</p>
							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								Embedded programming involves programming small computers to drive or operate devices, and for this
								purpose, we utilized Arduino, an open-source platform widely used for building electronics projects.
								Arduino comprises a physical programmable circuit board, often referred to as a microcontroller, and an
								integrated development environment (IDE) software running on our computers. The IDE allows us to write
								and upload computer code to the Arduino board, enabling us to bring our projects to life.
							</p>
							<p class="text-animate-hide mb-0">
								During this week, we explored fundamental programming constructs, which serve as building blocks for
								creating effective and functional code. These constructs include:
							</p>
							<ul class="text-animate-hide mb-0">
								<li>Sequencing: Determining the order in which instructions occur and are processed.</li>
								<li>Selection: Deciding which path the program takes based on certain conditions.</li>
								<li>Iteration: Repeatedly executing a section of code while the program is running.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								Additionally, we explored the concepts of digital and analog data representation. In digital systems,
								data is represented using binary digits, known as bits, with only two possible values: 0 or 1. On the
								other hand, analog systems represent data using a continuous range of values over a continuous scale.
							</p>
							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								To apply our newfound knowledge, we utilized Tinkercad, an easy-to-use drag-and-drop Arduino simulator.
								Before diving into the exercises, we were provided with a helpful
								<a
									href="static/images/Cheat Sheets.pdf"
									download
									>cheat sheet</a
								>
								that served as a valuable resource throughout the week. It assisted me in learning, referencing, and
								debugging my code.

							</h2>
							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								In week 11, we deviated slightly from the schedule to dive into the world of design thinking before
								exploring Arduino further. This shift in focus was a valuable addition as it equipped us with a powerful
								problem-solving approach for our final project.
							</p>
							<p class="text-animate-hide">
								Design thinking is an innovative methodology that empowers individuals to craft solutions by
								understanding and addressing specific user needs. To facilitate our design research, we learned about
								SPS analysis, a design thinking framework. SPS analysis comprises three key elements:
								<br />
								<i> Syntactic Analysis: Understanding the materials and dimensional scale of a product. </i>
								<br />
								<i> Pragmatic Analysis: Considering the functionality and ergonomics of how a product operates. </i>
								<br />
								<i>
									Semantic Analysis: Exploring the contextual interaction, form analogies, and emotional connection a
									product has with the user.
								</i>
							</p>
							<p class="text-animate-hide mb-0 pb-0">
								This newfound knowledge in design thinking provided us with a solid foundation to generate creative
								ideas for our final projects. We engaged in an activity where we brainstormed potential ideas, and here
								are a few of the concepts I came up with:
